# Fly Swift Tail â€” Private Flight Search (Demo)
Static HTML/CSS/JS prototype for pitching to private aviation operators and charter brokers.

## Deploy
- **GitHub + Vercel**: create a new repo, add this `index.html`, import to Vercel (no build step).
- **GitHub Pages**: enable Pages on the repo; the site will serve at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

This is a demo-only UI. The search button is non-functional and just shows an alert.
